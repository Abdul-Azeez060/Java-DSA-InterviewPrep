[ ] Read CONTRIBUTING.md: Before making any contributions, it's essential to thoroughly read and understand the guidelines provided in the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file. 
[ ] Original Work: Ensure that the pull request represents your own work and that you have not plagiarized or copied code from other sources. Original contributions are valued in open-source projects.
[ ] Automated Tests: Be aware that pull requests must pass automated tests to be merged. Make sure your code doesn't break existing functionality and that it meets the project's testing requirements.
[ ] One Algorithm per Pull Request: To facilitate efficient review and maintainability, open separate pull requests for each algorithm you are modifying or adding. 
[ ] File Placement: If you're adding new Python files, place them within existing project directories. 
[ ] Naming Conventions: Follow Python naming conventions for functions and variable names. Consistency in naming enhances code readability.
[ ] Type Annotations: Annotate function parameters and return values with Python type hints. This provides clarity on expected inputs and outputs and helps with code analysis.
[ ] Doctests: Include doctests in your functions. These tests are a form of inline documentation and should pass automated testing to ensure code correctness.
[ ] Include Explanatory URLs: For new algorithms, include at least one URL pointing to a relevant source, such as Wikipedia or another authoritative explanation. 
[ ] Resolve Issues: If your pull request addresses one or more open issues in the project's issue tracker, mention the issue number(s) in the pull request description using a closing keyword like "Fixes #ISSUE-NUMBER."
