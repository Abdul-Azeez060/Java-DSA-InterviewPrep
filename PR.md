Read CONTRIBUTING.md: Before making any contributions, it's essential to thoroughly read and understand the guidelines provided in the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file. This document typically contains information on coding standards, the development process, and other important project-specific details.

Original Work: Ensure that the pull request represents your own work and that you have not plagiarized or copied code from other sources. Original contributions are valued in open-source projects.

Automated Tests: Be aware that pull requests must pass automated tests to be merged. Make sure your code doesn't break existing functionality and that it meets the project's testing requirements.

One Algorithm per Pull Request: To facilitate efficient review and maintainability, open separate pull requests for each algorithm you are modifying or adding. This helps keep changes focused and easy to understand.

File Placement: If you're adding new Python files, place them within existing project directories. Maintain a tidy project structure, and ensure filenames are in all lowercase characters with no spaces or dashes.

Naming Conventions: Follow Python naming conventions for functions and variable names. Consistency in naming enhances code readability.

Type Annotations: Annotate function parameters and return values with Python type hints. This provides clarity on expected inputs and outputs and helps with code analysis.

Doctests: Include doctests in your functions. These tests are a form of inline documentation and should pass automated testing to ensure code correctness.

Include Explanatory URLs: For new algorithms, include at least one URL pointing to a relevant source, such as Wikipedia or another authoritative explanation. This helps users understand the algorithm's purpose and behavior.

Resolve Issues: If your pull request addresses one or more open issues in the project's issue tracker, mention the issue number(s) in the pull request description using a closing keyword like "Fixes #ISSUE-NUMBER."
