# Sorting Algorithms
A sorting algorithm is a method for reorganizing a large number of items into a specific order.
Such as alphabetical, highest-to-lowest value or shortest-to-longest distance. Sorting algorithms take lists of items as input data, 
perform specific operations on those lists and deliver ordered arrays as output. 

This section contains a lot of important algorithms that help us to use sorting algorithms in various scenarios.
